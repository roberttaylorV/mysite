# charasort
A web based character sorter. Allows users to run through a manual merge sort of their favorite
characters from a set.

**Features**
 * Entirely client side, no backend server required.
 * Filtering out characters based on JSON based filters.
 * Shareable links of sorter results.
 * Versioning of sorter data - you may want to add characters and resources over time. Versioning keeps shareable links valid even if the base character data is changed.
